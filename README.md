# Hello-Class

Hello! I'm Siddharth Singh. I have earned a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Medi-Caps University, Indore. Following the completion of my engineering degree, I joined Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Analyst. During my two-year tenure at Cognizant, I had the opportunity to learn and have a lot of fun!

Seeking to expand my knowledge in Computer Science further, I am currently enrolled in the MSc CDA Program at Saint Mary's University, Halifax. In my leisure time, I am passionate about watching MMA and Boxing.

We are three passionate students from India: Siddharth Singh, Raj Mehta, and Ranjit Pandey. We all share a deep love for Cricket, a sport that holds a special place in our hearts. Cricket, a bat-and-ball game, is one of the most popular sports in India, known for its thrilling matches and legendary players.

We are drawn to Cricket because it's not just a game; it's a part of our culture and identity. It brings people together, fostering a sense of unity and excitement. Our collective enthusiasm for this sport has led us to form a team dedicated to exploring the various facets of Cricket.

My Teammates:
1. Ranjit Pandey: He's from Mumbai, India, a city known for its financial importance and global popularity. He used to work as a Software Developer at LTIMindtree but always had a keen interest in learning more about Data Analytics. So, he decided to join the MSc CDA Program to pursue that passion. Ranjit really loves Cricket, and his favorite player is Virat Kohli.
Fun Fact: Ranjit used to be a boxer in high school.
2. Raj Mehta: He hails from Pandhurna, India. Both of us previously worked at Cognizant but on different projects. In order to broaden his understanding of Data Analytics and acquire practical experience, he decided to enroll in the MSc CDA program. Raj played cricket when he was a child, and his all-time favorite player is Rohit Sharma.
Fun Fact: Raj really likes playing video games.
